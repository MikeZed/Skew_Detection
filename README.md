# Skew_Detection
A small project I did as part of the Excellency Program of the Engineering Faculty in Tel Aviv University. 

The purpose was to train a Deep Learning model with the data set from "http://www.iit.demokritos.gr/~alexpap/DISEC13/icdar2013_benchmarking_dataset.rar", 
to identify the skew of images such as newspapers, documents, comics.

In order to use this repository you need the code from "Models_and_Data_Utils" repository. 

In the "Models Objects" folder you can find several trained models with their information and their training plot.
